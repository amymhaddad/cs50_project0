Course: Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

The aim of this project: Design a personal webpage about yourself, one of your interests, or any other topic of your choice. The subject matter, look and feel, and design of the site are entirely up to you, subject to the following requirements.

I created a webpage about myself and my interests. It includes a homepage (amymhaddad) and three links to separate pages on: writing, programming, and lifelong learning. Each page includes links, lists, and/or a table. And each page has its own stylesheet.
