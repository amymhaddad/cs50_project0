Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

I created a webpage about myself and my interests. It includes a hompage (amymhaddad) and three links to separate pages on: writing, programming, and lifelong learning. Each page includes links, lists, and/or a table. And each page has its own stylesheet. I intentionally use Flexbox on my website to get a lot of practice with it.
