# Project 0

Course: Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

I created a webpage about myself and my interests. It includes a homepage (amymhaddad) and three links to separate pages on: writing, programming, and lifelong learning. Each page includes links, lists, and/or a table. And each page has its own stylesheet. I intentionally use Flexbox on my website to get a lot of practice with it. 

This is how the project is organized:
index.html	
style.css
--->HTML and CSS files for the homepage of website

lifelong_learning directory:
index.html
style_lll_page.css
--->HTML and CSS files for lifelong learning page 

programming directory:
index.html	
style_programming_page.css
--->HTML and CSS files for programming page 

writing directory
index.html	
style_writing.css
--->HTML and CSS files for writing page
